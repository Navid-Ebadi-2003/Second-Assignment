## Introduction:
- make a Weather app that take data from server and show Temperature and Humidity

## Design and Implementation:
1. sign up and get API key from website
2. creat one jsonObject 
3. send the String that taken from mobin's function to the jsonObject 
4. make two function ; one for Temperature and one for Humidity
    - These function work with **getJSONObject** 
    - and to access json data specific keys are used 
5. send jsonObject to functions and print response

## Testing and Evaluation:
1. Tehran
    - Temperature: 60.8 F
    - Humidity: 13
2. Tabriz
    - Temperature: 41.0 F
    - Humidity: 38

## Conclusion:
- strengths of the solution : it uses only one jsonObject 
- weaknesses of the solution : functions use json dada directly
- for developing app we can use GUI or get more Information from json data
